Misskey is a distributed microblogging service using ActivityPub that is being continuously developed by [syuilo](culture/users/syuilo).
On April 4th of 2018, it started supporting the server-to-server communication protocol [ActivityPub](culture/words/activitypub), making it compatible with Mastodon and other similar distributed SNS.

For starters, let's begin with registering at an instance.
**[Find an instance](instances/)**

Misskey is open source software, with its [source code](https://github.com/syuilo/misskey) being [nearly freely modifiable under the AGPLv3 license](developers/modifying-code-and-license).
Therefore, it is easy to open your own instance as well.

The name "Misskey" comes from the lyrics of the May'n song called "Brain Diver" (Overheard when syuilo was thinking of a name).
